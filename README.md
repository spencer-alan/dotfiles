# Dot Files

These are my dotfiles so I can easily take them with me when I have to set up new enviornments. 

## Neovim

Initially I stared with [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) which was incredible and super great way to start using Neovim. 
Since then, I am making changes to it now in my own with a little help from some people that are smarter than me. 

### TODO for Neovim
- Look into closing tags and symbols (i.e. '[' or '}')
- Get all the LSP and formatter servers up and running to make life better

## Alacritty

I will hopefully be changing to Ghostty soon beacuse that just seems like it is really going to kick ass.

## Tmux

Still getting used to it but I will say,
being able to quickly open new panes and windows to do some 
quick git commands or check out air that is running while logging is awesome


### TODO for Tmux
- try and get a better more subtle tmux bar color. It is throwing me off when I am in Neovim with the different statuses
